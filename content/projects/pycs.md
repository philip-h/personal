Pycs is an autograder solution designed to simplify the assignment submission and grading process for both students and myself. Developed using Flask and integrated with Pytest and Junit5, Pycs allows students to register, sign in securely, join classes, view assignments, submit their work, and receive grades along with detailed feedback. Pycs was created to aid in the pedagogical practice of "learning to mastery", enabling students unlimited attempts to solve the problem at hand.
