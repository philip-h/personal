For a final year capstone project, our group created FollowThrough: a prototype for a basketball shot analyzer that helps players improve their free throw shot. As the lead software developper, I was in charge of ball detection using OpenCV, a Support Vector Machine model for initial ball detection and Mean Shift for movement tracking.
